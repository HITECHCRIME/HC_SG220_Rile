## Lyrics

```
hands up hands up squad
each and every one of us 

had a bad time 
bad time on the clock with lively people trickling poison into life 
into life into life int

gassed up dark shades rolling down on farce
these blessed cunts - no remorse shunning done
riled up tricks trapped into feeling scars 

ya messed with giants counting minutes till i'm gone

let me know your struggles wanna know what's been bothering your vibes

```
